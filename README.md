The Pomodoro Widget helps you manage your time effectively using the Pomodoro Technique.

### Transactions

In Calendar Aliquindoi, transactions play a crucial role in ensuring data integrity and consistency. When you initiate a transaction, such as creating, updating, or sharing an event, the application ensures that all the necessary steps are completed successfully. If any step fails, the transaction is rolled back, and no changes are made. This ensures that your data remains consistent and accurate at all times.

This screenshot illustrates a typical transaction process in the application.
